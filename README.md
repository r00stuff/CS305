## üîç Client Summary and Software Requirements
**Client:** Artemis Financial  
**Industry:** Financial Consulting  
**Software Requirements:**  
Artemis Financial provides personalized financial plans for its clients. The company needed to secure its public web interface to protect sensitive client data and financial information. The main requirement was to implement a checksum verification step using a cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA-256) and to enforce secure communications via HTTPS.

**Key Issue:**  
The web application lacked secure communication protocols and data verification mechanisms. Artemis Financial wanted to ensure that data transmitted through its platform was protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

## üõ°Ô∏è Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities
**What Went Well:**  
- Identified vulnerabilities related to insecure HTTP connections and lack of data verification.  
- Implemented SHA-256 hashing for checksum generation to ensure data integrity.  
- Enforced HTTPS by generating and deploying SSL certificates for secure communication.

**Importance of Secure Coding:**  
Secure coding prevents data breaches, protects user privacy, and ensures compliance with industry regulations. For a financial institution like Artemis Financial, software security is crucial for maintaining client trust and safeguarding sensitive information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Vulnerability Assessment Insights
**Challenging Aspect:**  
- Understanding the extensive reports generated by the OWASP Dependency-Check tool.  
- Ensuring the self-signed SSL certificates worked correctly with the application server configuration.

**Helpful Aspect:**  
- The OWASP Dependency-Check tool quickly highlighted outdated dependencies and potential vulnerabilities, making the remediation process more efficient.

## üîê Security Enhancements Implemented
**Security Layers Added:**  
- **SHA-256 Hashing:** Implemented for data integrity checks.  
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Configured HTTPS using self-signed certificates to secure web traffic.  
- **Static Code Analysis:** Used OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plugin to ensure no known vulnerabilities existed in the codebase.

**Future Vulnerability Assessment Plans:**  
- Utilize dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools like OWASP ZAP for real-time vulnerability detection.  
- Adopt industry frameworks such as OWASP ASVS for structured security assessments.

---

## ‚úÖ Functional and Security Validation
**Ensuring Functionality and Security:**  
- Conducted manual testing of the `/hash` endpoint to verify correct SHA-256 checksum generation.  
- Validated secure HTTPS connections using self-signed certificates.  
- Performed static analysis with the OWASP Dependency-Check tool post-refactoring to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
